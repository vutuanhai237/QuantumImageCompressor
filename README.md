     abstract="Image compression is an important problem in the image processing field and has been applied widely in various applications, from storage optimization and print media to image exchange. Almost all compressed image formats, such as Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) and Portable Network Graphics (PNG), have pros and cons, but there is always a balance between file size and image quality; the larger the file size, the greater the loss on the image. However, the hybrid quantum-classical approach provides us with a new way to compress images more efficiently. In this research, we propose a scheme that turns the image into a unitary operator's parameter, then we make a new image format via the quantum state preparation algorithm.",
